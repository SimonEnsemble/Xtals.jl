    repfactors = replication_factors(unitcell, cutoffradius)

Find the replication factors needed to make a supercell big enough to fit a sphere with the specified cutoff radius.
In Xtals.jl, rather than replicating the atoms in the home unit cell to build the supercell that
serves as a simulation box, we replicate the home unit cell to form the supercell (simulation box) in a for loop.
This function ensures enough replication factors such that the nearest image convention can be applied.
A non-replicated supercell has 1 as the replication factor in each dimension (`repfactors = (1, 1, 1)`).

# Arguments

  - `unitcell::Box`: The unit cell of the framework
  - `cutoff_radius::Float64`: Cutoff radius beyond which we define the potential energy to be zero (units: Angstrom)

# Returns    # Unit vectors used to transform from fractional coordinates to cartesian coordinates. We'll be

  - `repfactors::Tuple{Int, Int, Int}`: The replication factors in the a, b, c directions
